# GPT-Powered Meeting Assistant

This project demonstrates how to use OpenAI's GPT model and its function call feature to automate meeting scheduling, check user information, and manage availability in a database. It showcases how a language model (LLM) can be leveraged to automate common tasks while interacting with users in a natural, conversational manner.

## Overview

The Meeting Assistant is designed to:
- Create new meetings based on user input.
- Check existing users in the database and their availability.
- Use OpenAI's function calling feature to handle database transactions automatically.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how GPT models can be utilized to automate tasks and streamline communication with users by dynamically managing the flow of information, such as scheduling meetings and verifying availability, without manual intervention.

## Features

- Automates the process of scheduling meetings.
- Verifies user availability and checks existing data.
- Utilizes OpenAI's function calling feature to interact with a database.
- Provides a conversational interface for user interaction.

## Motivation

The project was developed to showcase how GPT models can be applied in real-world scenarios to automate database-driven tasks, particularly focusing on transaction automation (such as scheduling meetings) and natural language communication with users. It serves as an example of how AI can be integrated into business processes for efficiency.

## Technology Stack

- **OpenAI GPT (with function calling)**: Core engine for processing user input and automating tasks.
- **SQLite**: Used to manage users and meeting data.
- **Python**: Main programming language for backend logic.
