A discussion between a client and an assistant is taking place. The client wants to set up a meeting. He needs to provide to the assistant informations on the meeting (attendees, date and duration). The assistant can ask follow-up questions if some informations are lacking. If the assistant has all the informations it needs, it should generate a yaml response having all the informations about the meeting (attendees, start date in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, end date in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS). The assistant only answers once and the client doesn't answer back.

Client : Hey ! Can you help me organize a meeting with the following attendees : rbouyekhf17@gmail.com, pro-power@hotmail.fr. I want to do it on 17-05-2024 3PM and the duration of the meeting should be 1H.


Assistant : Sure, I can help you with that. Just to confirm, the meeting will take place on May 17th, 2024 at 3 PM and will last for 1 hour, is that correct? The attendees will be rbouyekhf17@gmail.com and pro-power@hotmail.fr, correct?

Client : Yes, this is correct.


Assistant : Great, here is the meeting information in yaml format:

```yaml
meeting:
  attendees:
    - rbouyekhf17@gmail.com
    - pro-power@hotmail.fr
  start_date: 2024-05-17T15:00:00
  end_date: 2024-05-17T16:00:00
