### Welcome to the Meeting Assistant!

This application is here to streamline your meeting scheduling process, making it easier and more efficient to manage and coordinate with colleagues.

#### Key Features:

- **Create New Meetings**: Simply provide essential details like attendees, title, start and end time, and the assistant will handle the rest—checking for available slots to ensure a time that works for everyone.

- **Availability Checks**: Whether organizing a meeting or checking someone’s availability, the assistant will confirm attendee schedules to help you secure the perfect time.

- **Database Email Verification**: The assistant will automatically check the organization’s database for attendee emails. If there’s a need for additional information, it will confirm with you directly.

- **User-Friendly Confirmations**: Before finalizing a meeting, the assistant will confirm all key details—meeting title, attendees, and time—to ensure everything is accurate and conflicts are avoided.

#### Important Notes:

- **Demo Application Only**: This app is for demonstration purposes only. No real meeting invitations are sent. It’s designed to showcase how a large language model (LLM) can assist in taking concrete actions by calling tools and interacting with data.

- **Focused on Scheduling**: Currently, the assistant is limited to creating and checking schedules for meetings. Editing or removing meetings is planned for future updates.

- **External Attendees**: If an attendee is outside the organization, the assistant can still invite them but will not have access to their full agenda.

Thank you for using the Meeting Assistant during its trial phase! We’re excited to help make your scheduling easier and more efficient.
